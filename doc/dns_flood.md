DNS Flood
=========

El ataque DNS flood o inundación DNS es un ataque de denegación de servicio distribuido en el que el atacante utiliza como objetivo uno o más servidores DNS de una zona para intentar agotar todos los recursos del servidor y dificultar la tarea de resolución de nombres.

Los servidores DNS ayudan a resolver las direcciones IP asociadas a las URLs. En un ataque de inundación DNS el atacante intenta saturar uno o más servidores DNS con tráfico aparentemente válido, agotando los recursos del servidor e impidiendo el acceso al tráfico legítimo.

DNS flood attacks should be clearly differentiated from DNS amplification attacks. DNS amplification is an asymmetrical DDoS attack in which the attacker sends out a small look-up query with spoofed target IP, making the spoofed target the recipient of much larger DNS responses. With these attacks, the attacker’s goal is to saturate the network by continuously exhausting bandwidth capacity.

DNS floods are symmetrical DDoS attacks. These attacks attempt to exhaust server-side assets (e.g., memory or CPU) with a flood of UDP requests, generated by scripts running on several compromised botnet machines.

A DNS flood attack is considered a variant of the UDP flood attack, since DNS servers rely on the UDP protocol for name resolution, and is a Layer 7 attack. With UDP-based queries (unlike TCP queries), a full circuit is never established, and thus spoofing is more easily accomplished. DNS flood - 25 million packets per second

To attack a DNS server with a DNS flood, the attacker runs a script , generally from multiple servers. These scripts send malformed packets from spoofed IP addresses. Since Layer 7 attacks like DNS flood require no response to be effective, the attacker can send packets that are neither accurate nor even correctly formatted.

The attacker can spoof all packet information, including source IP and make it appear that the attack is coming from multiple sources. Randomized packet data also helps offenders to avoid common DDoS protection mechanisms, while also like IP filtering (e.g., using Linux IPtables) completely useless.

Another common type of DNS flood attack is DNS NXDOMAIN flood attack, in which the attacker floods the DNS server with requests for records that are nonexistent or invalid. The DNS server expends all its resources looking for these records, its cache fills with bad requests, and it eventually has no resources to serve legitimate requests.

Mitigación
----------

**TODO**

Large Layer 3 attacks like DNS floods are very difficult for on-premises solutions to mitigate.

jijijaja’s approach to mitigating DNS floods is simple and hassle-free. The solution is enabled by a dedicated anti-DDoS 'DNS Protection' service. Using DNS Protection, clients are able to deploy jijijaja's multi-datacenter network in front of their DNS authoritative server—doing so without making any changes to their existing zone file settings.

With the DNS Protection in place, jijijaja becomes the destination for all incoming DNS queries, which are scrubbed on their way to their origin.

jijijaja users can then continue to set their own custom thresholds, with different values provided for the more likely-to-be-legitimate “safe” queries (e.g. ftp.mydomain.com). In addition, users can also manually enforce DNS freshens by electing to refresh all cached data or by selectively refreshing specific DNS records.
