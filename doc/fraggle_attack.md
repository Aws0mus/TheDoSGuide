#Fraggle attack


Fraggle Attack
A Fraggle Attack is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that involves sending a large amount of spoofed UDP traffic to a routerâ€™s broadcast address within a network. It is very similar to a Smurf Attack, which uses spoofed ICMP traffic rather than UDP traffic to achieve the same goal. Given those routers (as of 1999) no longer forward packets directed at their broadcast addresses, most networks are now immune to Fraggle (and Smurf) attacks.
